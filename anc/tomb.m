%TOMB: TOMB ALGOIRHTM FOR FORMING NEW MULTI-BERNOULLI COMPONENTS
%Syntax: [r,x,P] = tomb(pupd,rupd,xupd,Pupd,pnew,rnew,xnew,Pnew)
%Input:
% pupd(i,j+1) is association probability (or estimate) for measurement
%  j/track i
% rupd(i,j+1), xupd(:,i,j+1) and Pupd(:,:,i,j+1) give the probability of
%  existence, state estimate and covariance for this association hypothesis
% pupd(i,1) is miss probability (or estimate) for target i
% rupd(i,1), xupd(:,i,1) and Pupd(:,:,i,1) give the probability of
%  existence, state estimate and covariance for this miss hypothesis
% pnew(j) is the probability (or estimate thereof) that measurement j does
%  not associate with any prior component and is therefore a false alarm or
%  a new target
% rnew(j), xnew(:,j) and Pnew(:,:,j) give the probability of existence, 
%  state estimate and covariance for this new target multi-Bernoulli
%  component
%Output:
% r(i), x(:,i) and P(:,:,i) give the probability of existence, state 
% estimate and covariance for the i-th multi-Bernoulli  component
